### Adding a link

- Links are by category.

- Feel free to add to this list by submitting a pull request.
  Instructions for completing a pull request can be found in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

- If you add a link, please try to place it in its respective category, or create a new category if appropriate.

### Styling

- Right now, style is via [Simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/) cdn. If you'd like to provide more original styling, you can do so in `style.css`.
- Please try to keep any styling additions simple and easy to read.
- After you've added your styles, proceed to **comment out** the link to the Simple CSS cdn ( found in `index.html`), and **uncomment** the link to `style.css`
- Alternatively, if all you're doing is something simple like adding color, you can simply use the provided class names to style.

Thanks for viewing and happy learning!
